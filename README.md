### About Me
-I am a Full Stack Web developer pivoting from 10 years as a Red Seal Electrician. I am a lifelong learner, convinced that technology is the future of human evolution. I am going to be part of the evolution. Utilizing modern technologies that simultaneously enhance the Developer and User experience, I create applications that are a pleasure to use and maintain.

- I am excited about the future and what Web Development can do for my family. I live each day with a disciplined and persistent paradigm. I love challenges, puzzles of all types, and learning through failure. The profound sense of achievement when you turn a loss into success is the purest form of motivation. 

- I am a dedicated father, mountain biker, trail builder, climber and skier.er.
