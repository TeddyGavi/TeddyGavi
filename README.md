### 💬 About Me
- Web Development Diploma -- [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/)

- 🧭 My passion for technology started in my childhood with my father. He and I assembled many PCs together. I was always quick to play MS-Dos games.

- 💻 After studying Computer Science at University, I decided to support my wife during her Master's Degree on the west coast. When my daughter was born, I took the opportunity to pursue my passion and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have since developed a proficiency in various languages, frameworks, and libraries, including Next, TypeScript, Ruby, Sanity.io, Node.js, Express, jQuery, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Framer Motion. I also have experience with database management systems and serverless architectures via PostgreSQL and Microsoft Azure.

- 🌩️ As a former electrician, I bring a unique perspective to every project, combining my technical expertise with a passion for creative problem-solving and attention to detail honed from years of installing complex electrical systems. 

- ⛰️ When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending my free time mountain biking, trail building, climbing, skiing, and volunteering with SORCA since 2018 to assist in ongoing trail maintenance and trail building.
