### TLDR

I bring a unique, creative and detailed-orientated perspective to software development, from years of installing and documenting complex electrical systems. I am skilled at establishing empathetic connections with clients and managing stressful situations. In addition to implementing successful front and back-end applications, I am currently exploring the use cases of AI/ML.

### 💬 About Me

- Web Development Diploma -- [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/)

- 🧭 My passion for technology started in my childhood with my father. He and I assembled many PCs together. I was always quick to play MS-Dos games.

- 💻 After studying Computer Science at University, I decided to support my wife during her Master's Degree on the west coast. When my daughter was born, I took the opportunity to pursue my passion and learn Full Stack Development. I have since developed a proficiency in various languages, frameworks, and libraries, including Next, TypeScript, Ruby, Sanity.io, Node.js, Express, jQuery, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Framer Motion. I also have experience with database management systems and serverless architectures via PostgreSQL and Microsoft Azure.

- 🌩️ As a former electrician, I bring a unique perspective to every project, combining my technical expertise with a passion for creative problem-solving and attention to detail honed from years of installing complex electrical systems.

- ⛰️ When I'm not coding, I'm raising a daughter! When I have free time, I enjoy time mountain biking, trail building, climbing, skiing, and volunteering with SORCA since 2018 to assist in ongoing trail maintenance and trail building.
